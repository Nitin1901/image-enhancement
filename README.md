With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the codes required to produce the results in the manuscript: 

> N. S. Bommi, A. L. Costuchen, and S. Dev, Detecting Objects Under Extreme Illumination Conditions, *under review*, 2022.

Please cite the above paper if you intend to use whole/part of the code. This code is only for academic and research purposes.


## Code Organization
All codes are written in `python`. 

### Code 
The script to reproduce all the figures, tables in the paper are as follows:
+ `brightness_enhancement.py`: Performs this and that
+ `contrast_enhancement.py`: Performs this and that
+ `custom_model.py`: Performs this and that
+ `preprocess.py`: Performs this and that
+ `pretrained_model.py`: Performs this and that
+ `results.py`: Performs this and that
+ `sharpness_enhancement.py`: Performs this and that

### Dataset 
We also share the dataset used in our paper, and can be found in `./data/`.
